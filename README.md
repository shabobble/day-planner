# Work Day Scheduler

Fifth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description 

The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save a task for each hour of the day. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* When the application is opened, the current day and time are displayed at the top of the calendar.

* The calendar is built of timeblocks for the hours of a standard work day.

* The timeblocks are color-coded so that the user can tell at a glance which hours have passed, which are ahead, and what hour it is now.

* Clicking into the text area of one of the timeblocks allows the user to enter an event. 

* Clicking the save button next to the text area - after entering an event - will cause the text to be saved. 

* When the page is reloaded, saved events will persist.
